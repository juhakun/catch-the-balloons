# Childrens game *Catch the Balloons*

*Catch the Balloons* is a desktop game for one player at the age of approx. 5-10 years.
The game was created during my training to become a Java Software Developer. 
It was programmed in Java and GUI Swing to practice the implementation of multiple threads (several moving elements at the same time), also embedding sound and graphical elements as parts of the game.    
 

## Description
 
Before the game starts, one of two levels can be selected. Then you have to catch the red balloons that appear at random positions in the sky. The player is distracted by two clouds moving across the screen from left to right and vice versa. When a balloon is clicked, it explodes with a loud bang. If a star then appears, the player gets 1 point. Whether a star appears is also random. The game ends after 20 balloons. The points achieved are displayed and you can start over if you want. 


## Tools used

* Java 
* GUI Swing
* IDE: Eclipse


## Improvements, additions and updates
The game could be expanded with many great functions and the implementation could be refined. 
However, since it is only a practice project for multiple threading, it has been left as it is.
